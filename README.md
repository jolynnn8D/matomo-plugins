## Matomo Plugins

### About
The repository contains two Matomo plugins - User Flow and React Form Analytics. Both plugins are compatible on Matomo on-Premise, which is a free, open-source web analytics platform.  

Do note that this plugin was created for personal use and is **not affiliated with Matomo** in any way.

To install Matomo, visit the installation guide [here](https://matomo.org/docs/installation/).

To use either of the plugins, please refer to the README in the respective folders.

### Tracker
In addition to the plugins, there is a custom tracker made for React apps. The tracker is strictly necessary for the use of the React Form Analytics plugin. Apart from that, it provides a more convenient alternative to the [existing React tracker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datapunt/matomo-tracker-react) for use of Matomo plugins that involve page tracking, including User Flow.

### Development
To enable development mode on Matomo, please follow this [guide](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/getting-started-part-1).

To get a better understanding of the plugin structure of User Flow and React Form Analytics, refer to Section 2 of the [User Flow guide](https://gitlab.com/kpdoggie/interns/matomo-plugins/-/blob/master/UserFlow/docs/index.md). 

To understand how the tracker works, please read the README in the tracker folder.
